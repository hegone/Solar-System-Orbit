# Solar System Orbit Simulation

This project is a simulation of the solar system's orbits using Pygame. The simulation visually represents the orbits of the planets around the Sun, allowing users to interact with the simulation by zooming in and out, dragging the view, and controlling the speed of the simulation.

## Features

- **Real-time Simulation**: Displays the orbits and positions of the planets in real-time.
- **Zoom In/Out**: Use the mouse scroll wheel or `+` and `-` keys to zoom in and out of the solar system.
- **Drag View**: Click and drag the view to move around the solar system.
- **Play/Pause Button**: Toggle the simulation with a play/pause button.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the simulation using a speed control bar.
- **Reset Button**: Reset the view and simulation speed to default settings.
- **Planet Information**: Hover over a planet to display its name, orbital radius, and orbital period.
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Toggle fullscreen mode with the `F` key.

## Controls

- **Zoom In**: Scroll up or press `+`.
- **Zoom Out**: Scroll down or press `-`.
- **Drag View**: Click and hold the left mouse button to drag the view.
- **Play/Pause**: Click the play/pause button in the top left corner.
- **Adjust Speed**: Drag the speed control bar in the top left corner.
- **Reset**: Click the reset button in the top left corner.
- **Fullscreen**: Press `F` to toggle fullscreen mode.
